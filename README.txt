SafeRent API Example
Written in PHP by Will Bradley (twitter.com/willbradley)

This is a basic, sample implementation of the CoreLogic SafeRent API (MITS) in PHP.
Contact your representative for documentation; I'm only sharing this since I wrote it and thought others might find it useful.
I am not affiliated with CoreLogic in any way.

This code is released to the public domain.

You'll need both the request.xml and index.php files; the PHP XML request object is built off the request.xml file, modified in index.php based on user input, and POSTed to SafeRent.

To use, modify request.xml and insert your account details in the four fields that say YOUR_USERNAME, etc.

Pull requests are welcome and re-sharing is encouraged.
